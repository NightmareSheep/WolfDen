            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This is the Wolf Den where I work on my hobby project. It is a turn-based strategy game which takes inspiration from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/">Into The Breach</a>. Right now only the multiplayer is functional. If you want to try it out then bring a friend and host a game. You can begin by setting you're nickname in the profile tab in the top right.</p>
            <p>Any feedback is welcome on my <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/QJ3PPVsN">discord</a></p>
